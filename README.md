## Getting Started

To get up and running with a Swift + Kitura project simply clone this repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/jesspittman/kitura-quick-start.git`

and then change into the new directory and build it with:  
`swift build`

You can then run the built project with:  
`.build/debug/kitura-quick-start`

To generate a `.xcodeproj` file for opening this directory in Xcode, you will need this command:  
`swift package generate-xcodeproj`
